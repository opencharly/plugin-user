// Command serve is the OUT-OF-PROCESS entrypoint for the user kit check verb (M1):
// a thin shim serving the importable verb over go-plugin gRPC via sdk.ServeCheckVerb,
// which reconstructs the kit.CheckContext from the host's reverse channel. The SAME
// verb compiles INTO charly in-process when listed in compiled_plugins; this binary is
// host-built + connected only when it is NOT — placement is invisible above the registry
// (the M1 completion: every compiled-in kit verb is now dual-placement).
